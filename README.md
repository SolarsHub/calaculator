# calaculator

Found image to use of calculator - To be decided whether it's a final choice or not.

To do:

1. Draft out basic HTML/SCSS page with basic functionality.
    <!-- - Include functional buttons -->
    <!-- - Proper placement of buttons -->
    <!-- - Include area for input -->
    <!-- - Make proper use of divs and class/id -->

2. Work on theme for calculator.(additional, not needed/important can be left out if needed)
    - See how true to the picture I will be
    - Decide whether to add anything extra
    - Shapes, design, pictures, fancy fonts.

3. Start on JS design
    - Look into functions, if/else and loops
    - Piece together example working code for an input from the buttons

4. Troubleshoot/debuging/testing.
    - Concatinate numbers together before adding a function ie 1 2 3 becoming 123 / 2 4 6 246

Messed around with shape of the buttons and which buttons to include.
Tried to round out the output box, it turned into an oval.
